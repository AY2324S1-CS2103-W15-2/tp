* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ProfBook_) used for managing tasks, group schedules, and notes for every tutorial slot and group.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ProfBook` because it sounds similar to the name of `AddressBook` projects. It aims to help professors to keep updated and informed with notifications and profile pictures of students for a personal touch and easy recognition of students during lessons.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ProfBook Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
