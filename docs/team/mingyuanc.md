### Project: ProfBook

ProfBook is a desktop address book application used for easy management of tasks, group schedules, and notes for every
tutorial slot and group. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is tailor-made
to mimic the familiar terminal experience for our target users by introducing Linux-style commands, Dynamic commands and
a terminal like structure and interface. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features Contribution

* **Designed the ProfBook folder structure**:
  * This folder structure allows our target users to organise their groups and students in an intuitive way
  * justification:
    * The folder structure closely mimics the natural hierarchy that our target user are familiar to.
    * Such a structure would allow us to create more tailor-fit features such as Dynamic command and terminal-like
      structure.
  * Highlights:
    * Deep understanding of OOP principals was needed to craft classes generic yet robust enough to capture the 
      behaviour of each hierarchy. This proved to be difficult as in-depth analysis of design alternative were required
    * Implementation was challenging as it was hard to integrate with our dynamic commands.


### Classes Contribution

* **Introduced `TaskListManager` Class**:
    * Manages the required operations of TaskList, reduces duplicated code.
    * Ensure the expected behaviour with regard to managing the tasks
        * No Duplicate tasks
        * Able to accept subclasses of Tasks
        * Other classes not being able to directly modify tasks

* **Introduced `ChildManager` Class**
    * Manages the operation required to modify the children, reduces duplicated code.
    * Ensure the expected behaviour with regard to managing the children.
        * No Duplicate children across the whole ProfBook.
        * Children are identified by their Unique ID.
        * Other classes not being able to directly modify children.

* **Introduced `ChildAndTaskListManager` Class**
  * Wrapper class that manages the operations required for both TaskList and Children.

* **Introduced `Student` Class**
  * Encapsulates the required information to represent student.

* **Introduced `Group` Class**
  * Encapsulates the required information to represent a group within tutorial group.

* **Introduced `Root` Class**
  * Encapsulates the required information to represent the whole application.

* **Introduced `TaskOperation` and `ChildOperation` facade Class**
  * Provided a facade class to allow `Command` logic to manipulate the model without exposing internal details.
  * Justification:
    * Follows OOP principals more closely.
    * Allows for the future migration to an immutable model.
    * Adds another layer of safety by checking the validity and presence of the directory before performing modification.
  * Highlights:
    * Deep-understanding of what is required by `Command` class was required when designing this facade class.

* **Enhanced `ModelManager` Class**
  * Provides the logic to safely manipulate data stored in Student/Group/Root

### Project Management:

* Managed Releases v1.2 on GitHub
* Created and assigned issues for V1.3, V1.4

## Documentations:

### User Guide Contributions
* **Non-Feature Aspects**
  * Transferred initial command description from Google documents into Markdown format.
  * Provided skeleton format for each command so that teammates are able to more efficiently populate their features.
  * Wrote the overview of the whole project.
  * Wrote the overview for all three of our main features.
  * Updated the command summary page.
* **Feature Aspects:**
  * `cat` command.

### Developer Guide Contributions
* **Non-Feature Aspects**
    * Migrated old documents to follow ProfBook new requirements and style.
    * Updated introduction paragraphs .
    * Proofread peer's contributions and performed changes for a more seamless reading experience.
    * Performed final checks before submitting.
* **Feature Aspects:**
    * Wrote and create UML for `Model` component including it subpackages such as:
      * `ProfBook`
    * Wrote and created UML for the implementation of
      * Folder structure
      * Moving students
      * Adding a student/group
      * Editing a student/group
      * Adding tasks for all/specific student/group
